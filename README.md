Perfomance evaluation

Confusion Matrix: It is a matrix of size 2Ã—2 for binary classification with actual values on one axis and predicted on another.

Accuracy Score: Accuracy is the measure of correct predictions made by our model.It is equal to the number of correct predictions made upon total number of predictions made by the model.

Precision Score: It is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true andfalse positives. It is also known as Positive Predictive Value (PPV).

Recall Score: It is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It is also called True Positive Rate (TPR) or sensitivity.

F1 score: It is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The closer the value of the F1 score is to 1.0 , the better the expected performance of the model is.

OBSERVATION

Here there is difference between the accuracy of balanced data and imbalanced data.

so we can choose the balanced data with XGBoost has best model

CONCLUSION


Here we first fit the model using imbalanced data with the accuracy and f1 score corresponding that model. Next we get a better model when we use balanced data . So here balanced data gives better accuracy and f1 score.

In conclusion, this notebook provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction in the airline industry. Factors such as inflight entertainment, seat comfort, ease of online booking, and online support have a significant impact on satisfaction levels.

The factors on which airlines needs to focus more is on the 'Arrival Delay in Minutes' and 'Departure Delay in Minutes'

Based on the analysis, we recommend focusing on improving these areas to enhance customer experiences and increase satisfaction.
